title: About
---
I'm a graduate of Austin Peay State University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mobile Software Development. I'm currently a software developer at [MedHost](http://www.medhost.com/). I was also a developer for the Mobile Technology GIS Center and SLA Leader for a CSCI 1010 course at APSU. I'm a highly motivated, self-starter with a huge interest in computer science and technology.

My hobbies outside of school include programming, learning new stuff, almost anything outdoors, soccer, hiking, and travel. I'm always up for seeing new places and trying new things.

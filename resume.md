##### Employment History
**2014-current**:<br>
*Software Developer - MedHost in Franklin, TN*<br>

**2013-2014**:<br>
*Software Developer - Mobile Technology GIS Center at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, TN*<br>
I've worked on several web and mobile applications, both existing and new. I was tasked with moving our development practices and applications to a more structured and testable work flow. I started by designing and implementing REST services using a PHP web framework to build an asset management system which interfaces with the clients' exsiting system to extend functionality and allow inventory tracking and modification. This also included the creation of a web frontend and a mobile iOS application that works with the RESTful backend as well. I am currently leading the transition of the structure of our web applications over to Node.js implementing similar RESTful services for new and existing projects. These projects currently make use of client side frameworks like Angular.js or Backbone.js to create robust single page web applications as well as native mobile applications for both iOS and Android devices.

**2013**:<br>
*SLA Leader - CSCI 1010E class at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, TN*<br>
As an SLA Leader at APSU I taught an enhanced lab class for CSCI 1010E Intro to Programming. This was an introductory class to programming using C++. I was responsible for creating a lesson plan each week that followed along with what the students were learning during standard class sessions. I would review and explain basic programming concepts in C++, answer questions related to assignments and problems, and help prepare the students for quizzes and exams.

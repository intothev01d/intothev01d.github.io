##### [Asset Management](http://www.apsu.edu/news/apsu-student-and-gis-center-develop-inventory-app)
I designed and implemented a REST service using a PHP web framework for an asset management system during my time at the Mobile Techonology GIS Center at APSU. The system interfaces with the clients' exsiting software to extend functionality and allow inventory tracking and modification. This also included the creation of a web frontend built in part with Backbone.js and an iOS application that worked with the RESTful backend as well.

##### [Numberator - Random Number Generator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numberator-random-number-generator/id592819993?mt=8)
I designed and developed Numberator between December 2012 and January 2013. This is my first app on the iTunes App Store. It is a random number generator that generates numbers in a given range which can be viewed individually, in lists, or emailed.  

##### [Algebra Tiles app for the iPad](http://www.apsu.edu/csci)
My first iOS project. I started this in May 2012 and finished the first version in September 2012. It was part of a research project to determine the effetiveness of virtual manipulatives in the classroom. The app allowed students to manipulate tiles on a board as a representation of the pebble model used in mathematics curricula to express positive and negative integers and addition and subtraction. I was invited to and presented the research for this project at NCUR 2013.
